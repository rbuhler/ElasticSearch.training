````aidl
Hello Andreas,
Following our call back in March, we are well advanced with our Elastic Search deployment on Neo + Open Stack and would now like to deploy on Cloud Foundry in the goal to productize it on SCP.
Do you know whom we should contact for:
•	Existing deployment documentation (e.g. fresher version of https://jam4.sapjam.com/wiki/show/TBCfYarMhTprSPnIepQWk0 without the dead links)?
•	Existing product standards for SCP/Cloud Foundry/Open Stack
•	SCP/Cloud Foundry/Open Stack DevOps
Thank you in advance for your help and have a nice week-end,

PS: copying Rodrigo who has asked the same question on the jam
